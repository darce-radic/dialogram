# Data Policy Template

Use this as a product-policy baseline and align with legal counsel before publishing as a binding policy.

## Ownership

- Customers retain ownership of the content they create and store in Dialogram.
- Customers control who can access their workspaces.

## Processing Scope

- Data is processed to provide platform functionality (collaboration, storage, integrations, support).
- Data is not used for unrelated purposes outside documented policy scope.

## Model Training

- Workspace content is **not** used to train foundation models by default.
- Any training usage requires explicit customer opt-in.

## Security Controls

- Encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS).
- Encryption at rest for stored data.
- Access controls based on authenticated identity and workspace membership.
- Logging and auditing for critical actions where feasible.

## Retention, Export, Deletion

- Customers should be able to export key workspace data.
- Customers should be able to delete workspace data, subject to required legal retention obligations.

## Subprocessors & Third Parties

- Publish and maintain a list of subprocessors used to provide the service.
- Contractual safeguards apply to subprocessors handling customer data.

## Incident Response

- Maintain incident response procedures.
- Notify impacted customers in line with contractual and legal requirements.

## Wording Guardrail

Avoid absolute statements that are hard to guarantee forever (for example, “never in any circumstance”). Prefer precise, enforceable language tied to explicit policy scope.
